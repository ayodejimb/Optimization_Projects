# Optimization Projects

This repository contains code that I have written in MATLAB for obtaining optimal solutions on various kinds of optimization problems. 

For a linear optimization problem, I implemented the following:

(i) Exhaustive Basic Feasible Solution
(ii) One Phase Simplex Method
(iii) Two Phase Simplex Method

For a non-linear optimization problem, I implemented the following:

(i) Golden Search Method (for a single dimensional search)
(ii) Secant's Method (for a single dimensional search)
(ii) Newton's Method (for a single dimensional search)
(iv) Steepest descent Method (for multi-dimensional search but with Newton's method for line search)

Each respective folder contains the implementation for each category.
